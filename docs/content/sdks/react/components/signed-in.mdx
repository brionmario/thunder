# `<SignedIn />`

The `<SignedIn />` component conditionally renders its children only when a user is authenticated. It's useful for showing content that should only be visible to signed-in users.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { SignedIn } from '@thunder/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedIn>
        <Dashboard />
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With SignedOut

Combine with `<SignedOut />` for complete conditional rendering:

```jsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton } from '@thunder/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedIn>
        <Dashboard />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Protecting Routes

```jsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@thunder/react';
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProtectedPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <div>Protected Content</div>
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <Navigate to="/sign-in" replace />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Content to render when user is signed in |

## Notes

- Children are only rendered when authentication state is confirmed
- Use with `<Loading />` to handle the initial authentication check
- No props are passed to children components
